BY SYAKIR ZAHARI

# Step

2. Enter folder directory and run `npm install`

# Explanation & Challeng

1. Since no API endpoint to consume, I develop sample crud app using useState function
2. Build using latest React Native Expo and JSX as programming language.
3. To-do later:

i. To extend this sample using Redux State Management
ii. Integrate with ReSTFUL API endpoint using Axios
iii. Add some authentication method to access the app
