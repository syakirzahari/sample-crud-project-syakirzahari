# CRUD PROJECT USING REACT NATIVE

BY SYAKIR ZAHARI

# Step

1. Clone project to local
2. Enter folder directory and run `npm install`
3. run `npx expo start`

# Explanation & Challenge

1. Since no API endpoint to consume, I develop sample crud app using useState function
2. Build using latest React Native Expo and JSX as programming language.
3. To-do later:

- To extend this sample using Redux State Management
- Integrate with ReSTFUL API endpoint using Axios
- Add some authentication method to access the app
